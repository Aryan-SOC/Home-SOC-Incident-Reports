# 🛡️ Home SOC Lab: Real-World Alert Investigation, Incident Response & Documentation

Welcome to my Home SOC Lab!  
I'm **Shewag Bhattarai**, a passionate SOC Analyst-in-training and cybersecurity enthusiast, on a mission to master the art of incident detection, investigation, and response. This repository is my hands-on journey, where I turn my home lab into a high-fidelity simulation of a real Security Operations Center.

## 🚀 Why This Lab? My Commitment to Security Excellence

In the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, theory alone isn’t enough. This repository is where I push beyond textbooks—documenting realistic alert investigations, incident reports, and response strategies, all generated from threats and anomalies detected in my home-built enterprise-grade lab.

**Every alert. Every anomaly. Every lesson.**  
My goal: Develop world-class incident response habits through continuous, structured documentation and end-to-end SOC workflows.

## 🧰 What Powers This Lab?

- **Wazuh** – Open-source Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)
- **Splunk** – Industry-leading log aggregation, search, and alert correlation
- **Suricata** – High-performance network-based IDS for real-time packet analysis
- **TheHive + Cortex** – Case management and automated response orchestration
- **Kali Linux** – For attack simulation, red teaming, and adversary emulation
- **GCP + VirtualBox** – Hybrid cloud/on-prem deployment for real-world scenarios

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

- **Step-by-step investigations** of actual security alerts detected in the lab
- **Timelines, root cause analysis, and IOC summaries** (IPs, hashes, domains, etc.)
- **Screenshots** from Splunk, Wazuh, or Suricata dashboards and packet captures
- **Incident reports** following a proven template
- **Final recommendations and hard-won learnings** after every investigation

## 🔭 My Forward-Looking Goals

- 🚦 Automate case handling with TheHive + Cortex workflows
- 🎯 Map each alert and response to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- 🦠 Add malware analysis reports (REMonux/Cuckoo)
- 🤝 Open the repo for collaboration and knowledge-sharing

## 💡 Why This Matters

This isn’t just a personal project—it's my commitment to mastering blue team skills and contributing to the security community.  
I believe **structured documentation** and relentless hands-on practice turn curiosity into real-world expertise.
